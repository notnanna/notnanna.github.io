<!-- For this assignment I have chosen the context of cooking and arts tutorials.
1) so with this assignment, I had chosen not to include other videos because I thought basing my website on the aesthetics in this video would work well, also being that this video is on the older side, I dind't want to include other videos that would appear newer. I just wanted to work around the one video.
2) I also found that not having too many items up on screen allowed my to make it simple (as the video also is). I also considered that the site may be for little children or parents of small children, so I didn't want to over complicate things. I worked on having a seperate section below the video for the text elements - I saw that writing them down would also be a means of accessibility for those who either prefer reading, or for those who are deaf/hard of hearing.
3) While working on this assignment, I had tried to find a way to implement a button where the viewer could press it and the appropriate text for the section of the video would appear, but unfortunately I wasn't able to appropriately fulfil that function so I chose to not include it (I commented on thise sections specifically). I also realised that considering teh audience, that may not be the most easy way for them to navigate the website, so I felt that laying the steps out as I did to be more appropriate!

        <ul id="steps">
          <li>1. Cut up your sheet of foam into 12.5cm square</li>
          <br>
            <li>2. Fold square diagonally in half (make a triangle). Unfold it, turn it arround and fold in the other direction</li>
            <br>  
            <li>3. Make a hole in the middle of square, where the creases meet. Cut halfway inwards, from each point<br> and punch in holes are each corner - hole in the middle, hole on every other side</li>
            <br>    
            <li>4. Add some glue under each hole. bring one section into the midde (make sure the hole on the corner<br> meets the hole in the middle) and stick it down. Keep folding each section with a hole down into the centre<br> until there are no more holes left</li> 
            <br>      
            <li>5. Using the lid of a gluestick and some leftover pieces of foam, mark the foam with and cut out the shape<br> to make a circle. Put a hole in the middle (make two)</li>
            <br>        
            <li>6. Wrap pipecleaner around straw, put circle onto the pipecleaner, feed the pipecleaner through the hole in the <br>windmill (from the back , through the front). put the second circle onto the front of the windmil</li>
            <br>          
            <li>7. Using a pair of scissors, cut a little bit of the pipecleaner off from the front, and twit the remainer into a little nob in the front</li>
            <br>            
            <li>8. Try out the windmill, and try spinning it a few times as the foam may be a bit still, so you will have to <br>tweak it and find out wher it sits comfortably</li>
